# Authentication

Invaro API uses Bearer token authentication for securing all API endpoints. You'll need to include your API key in the Authorization header for all requests.

## API Keys

Your API key serves as your account's identity and should be kept secure. You can obtain your API key from the Invaro dashboard.

### Authorization Header

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer scheme:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.invaro.ai/api/v1/parse/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
  -F "files=@statement.pdf"
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep your API key secure**
   - Never share your API key or commit it to version control
   - Use environment variables to store your API key
   - Rotate your API key periodically

2. **Use HTTPS**
   - Always make requests over HTTPS
   - We reject all non-HTTPS requests

3. **Key Rotation**
   - You can generate new API keys from the dashboard
   - Maintain a list of active keys
   - Revoke compromised keys immediately

## Rate Limiting

Each API key has its own rate limit. See our [Rate Limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) page for more details.

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Invalid API key provided"
  }
}
```
