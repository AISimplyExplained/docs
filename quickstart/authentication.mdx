## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in all API requests using the Bearer token format in the Authorization header:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.invaro.ai/api/v1/parse/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
  -F "files=@document.pdf"
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key'
};

const response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: headers
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep your API key secret** - Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories
2. **Use environment variables** - Store your API key in environment variables
3. **Rotate keys periodically** - Regularly rotate your API keys for enhanced security
4. **Use separate keys** - Use different API keys for development and production

<Warning>
Never share your API key or commit it to version control. If your key is compromised, rotate it immediately from your dashboard.
</Warning>
